 ## 1. Introduction

This repository contains the code for an interactive web application that allows users to explore the history of the Olympic Games. The application is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web apps. The data used in the application is from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/olympic-games) dataset.
### 2. Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need the following:

* Python 3.6 or later
* Streamlit
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* plotly

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

### 3. Running the Application

To run the application, clone this repository and then run the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will then be available at http://localhost:8501.

### 4. Code Explanation

The code for the application is contained in the `app.py` file. The code is divided into the following sections:

* **Imports**
* **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
* **Sidebar**
* **Main Content**

#### 4.1 Imports

The first section of the code imports the necessary libraries.

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import streamlit as st
import helper
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.figure_factory as ff
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```

#### 4.2 Data Loading and Preprocessing

The second section of the code loads the data from the CSV files and then preprocesses it.

```
dataset1 = pd.read_csv('athlete_events.csv')
dataset2 = pd.read_csv('noc_regions.csv')

dataset = helper.preprocess(dataset1,dataset2)
```

The `preprocess()` function drops the duplicate rows from the dataset and then merges the two datasets on the `NOC` column.

#### 4.3 Sidebar

The third section of the code creates the sidebar for the application. The sidebar allows users to select the data they want to explore.

```
sidebar_data = st.sidebar.radio(
    'Select an Option',
    ('Medal Tally','Overall Analysis','Countrywise Analysis
